# Ping-Pong game
This project will present the development of a classic ping pong game using Python, titled "Ping Pong". The objective was to create an interactive and entertaining game that demonstrates key programming and game development principles. Turtle: The turtle is a built-in module in Python which is used for graphical illustrations. The users can use it as a pen and panel to illustrate the graphics.

The following are the steps used for illustrating Ping Pong game:

Step 1: The user has to create two Paddles for the "Left Side" and "Right Side" of the screen.<br> Step 2: The user then has to create the ball.<br>  Step 3: Then, create an event for moving the paddles vertically by pressing the particular keys, that is, for "Left Paddle": "e" for "Up" and "d" for "Down", for "Right Paddle": "Up key ()" for "Up" and "Down key ()" for "Down".<br>  Step 4: At last, create the function for updating the score after each player misses the strike on the ball.
